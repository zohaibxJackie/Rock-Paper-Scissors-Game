The question is that how to know in the phase 2 component that which button was clicked
Ans 
It basically starts in the phase_1 file. we add onClick function on every button and 
pass a parameter named after each button such as Rock.
we pass a prop in the parent function in phase_1 file named onButtonClick.
so whenever a user clicks on the button, this function will be invoked.

In the app.jsx file, we made handleButtonClick function. 
It will be invoked every time a user clicks on the button in the phase_1 file.
In that function, we are updating the value that is coming in the parameter from phase_1 file, the default value is null.
we used the useState for this task.
Also, we used useNavigation. so whenever handleButtonClick function is called, the route will directly change to /selection-result

In the phase_2 file, we are recieving the selected string in userChoice variable that was sent in the app.jsx file.
